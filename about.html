    <div class="about-content">
      <p class="fade-para">I’m a self-learning student driven by curiosity and purpose. My learning journey began with a
        deep interest in low-level programming, where I started exploring the power of languages like C and Rust, and
        working within the Linux environment.</p>
      <p class="fade-para">In the near future, I aim to dive into Ada to understand how systems are built with safety
        and precision.</p>
      <p class="fade-para">I'm also actively learning Python and have already begun working on real-world tools like QR
        code generators, video editors, automation scripts, and network applications.</p>
      <p class="fade-para">At the same time, I’m entering the world of Artificial Intelligence, building my foundations
        in AI development with Python.</p>
      <p class="fade-para">In addition, I’m learning frontend web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and beginning to
        work with backend technologies like Node.js and PHP — gradually becoming a full stack developer.</p>
      <p class="fade-para">My interests also extend into ethical hacking and cybersecurity, where I’m learning about
        network protocols, Linux-based security tools, and writing my own hacking scripts.</p>

    <h2 class="heading">About Religious Life</h2>
    <div class="about-content">
      <p class="fade-para">My journey isn’t just about code. At the core of my identity is my relationship with ALLAH,
        the QURAN, and the wisdom passed through the Prophets (peace be upon them).</p>
      <p class="fade-para">I believe that true knowledge isn't just what we compute — it’s what we contemplate.</p>
      <p class="fade-para">As I learn technology, I also study what I call "sudo sciences" — deep insights and
        metaphysical patterns embedded within the Quran, which guide us like root commands for understanding the
        universe.</p>
      <p class="fade-para">I believe that just as we use command-line tools to control our system, the Quran gives us
        root access to the reality of life — its laws, rhythms, and unseen truths.</p>
      <p class="fade-para">Every byte I write is in service to a deeper purpose — to align my skills with divine wisdom.
